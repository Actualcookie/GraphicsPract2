Tim implemented part 1, part 2 was implemented by both Tim and Lars.

We used a directional light for the Lambertian shading.

We chose to implement the Phong algorithm, and it was implemented in the pixel shader.
We chose to put in in the pixel shader to create a more accurate reflection, as opposed to the interpolated results we'd be getting from doing it in the vertex shader.
